# 🌐 Tesmo Project

This repository contains the source code for one of my projects named **Tesmo**, built with **PHP, Laravel, HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.\

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an online grocery platform designed to enhance the shopping experience with a user-friendly and secure interface. Built using PHP and Laravel, it supports user registration and secure authentication. Users can easily browse through categorized products, search for specific items, and add them to a dynamic shopping basket. The platform features a seamless checkout process, integrated with a built-in wallet system that enables users to manage funds. Additionally, users can create an account and login as an existing customer and view their shopping basket history.
